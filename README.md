# netflix-clone

During my internship at Bharat Inter, I had the incredible opportunity to showcase my web development skills by creating a Netflix clone using HTML and CSS. 🚀💻 I delved into the world of front-end development, meticulously crafting each element to mirror the seamless and user-friendly interface of the original platform.

🎨 Leveraging my creativity, I implemented captivating designs, ensuring an engaging user experience. From dynamic layout structures to responsive design principles, I integrated the latest web development trends to bring the clone to life.

🌐 The project not only honed my coding abilities but also enhanced my problem-solving skills as I navigated through the intricacies of building a feature-rich streaming platform. Through diligent testing and debugging, I ensured a smooth and polished final product.

👨‍💻 This internship provided me with hands-on experience, allowing me to contribute to a real-world project and further solidifying my passion for web development. I am proud to have been part of the Bharat Inter team, where I could apply my skills and creativity to create a project that mirrors the industry standards.
